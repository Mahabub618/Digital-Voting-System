# Digital-Voting-System (An android applicatoin)
This project is aimed to develop an optimize process of conducting elections to the parliament, legislature and local bodies. The system is developed based on the online system. So, voter do not need to present in the vote center or do not need to wait a long serial. They can cast their vote from home, office, vehicle, hospital or from anywhere and any place. After ended of the election, all the voters have to wait for the result of the election. Manually vote counting is another lengthy process. Our developed system will count each and every vote automatically and stored into the online database. There is no need to count manually. The database will show the total vote count of each candidate in non-decreasing order. So, it will be easy to show how much vote a candidate have gotten and who will be the winner of the election. In EVM or Ballot box system it is the big problem to incapable of taking vote in parallelly. It means, the voting process is held in one-by-one system. A voter can cast their vote only after the complete of his/her previous serial person. But our system can take vote in parallelly. At a time more than one voter can cast their vote and data also can processed in parallel. Itâ€™s easy to change any massive function of voting system by firmware update and no need to change any hardware tools.

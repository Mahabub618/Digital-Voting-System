# Digital-Voting-System (An android applicatoin)
At present, the voting system is so complicated and time consuming. Without physical attendance in the vote center voter cannot vote to his/her candidate. That is why, voter needs to go to the vote center and need to take a long serial for voting. Voter from distance place cannot cast his/her vote. Also, authenticating the voter is not so good well. So, there are lots of chances for vote cheating or ballot hijacks. The result has to be manually counted and that is a lengthy procedure. We believe smartphones are most likely to be used in the election settings that we considered. So, our android system is developed to save time and remove any kind of vote cheating. The system is developed an android application by which a voter can cast his/her vote anytime and from any place of the world.
